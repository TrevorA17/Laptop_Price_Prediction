# Laptop Price Prediction
Welcome to my Laptop Price Prediction project! This project aims to provide a convenient solution for predicting the prices of laptops based on their features. I've developed a robust machine learning model using linear regression, leveraging a dataset comprising various attributes such as brand, processor speed, RAM size, storage capacity, screen size, and weight. The model has been deployed as a RESTful API using the Plumber package in R, allowing users to easily make predictions by sending HTTP requests with the relevant laptop specifications. Whether you're a consumer looking to estimate the cost of a potential purchase or a retailer seeking pricing insights, my API provides accurate and reliable predictions to meet your needs. I'm excited to share this predictive tool with you and hope it proves valuable in your decision-making process. Feel free to explore my API and integrate it into your applications to streamline laptop price estimation.
